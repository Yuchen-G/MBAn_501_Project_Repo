- Every summer, there is an [Art Fair](https://www.theannarborartfair.com/) in July where many vendors will come and set up tents on the streets of downtown Ann Arbor and sell their artwork or other artistic items. This is a great way to learn about all the unique designs and objects people hand make.

- During the month of July, there is also a [carnival](https://a2jaycees.org/carnival) at Pioneer High School, located just across the street from the Michigan Stadium. Even as a graduate student, booths with fair games and food, a Ferris wheel, and other amusement park rides will be hard to resist on a hot summer day!

The summer is also the perfect time to purchase any winter apparel that will help you get through Michigan winters. Although the following places are located at least a 30-minute drive from Ann Arbor, it is a good idea to visit them during the summer, for example during the one-week break between the summer and fall semesters, to make sure that you are as well-prepared as possible for the colder months.

## Things to Do

Movies - want to watch a movie during your study break? Check out the Michigan Theater or State Theater, both located on and near South State Street. If you want to go off campus or have a wider selection of films, Cinemark is also a nearby option.

### Museums
- University of Michigan Museum Art [UMMA](https://www.umma.umich.edu/) is located in the heart of central campus, and the tall red sculpture right outside can be easily spotted anymore on South State Street. One fun fact about this sculpture is that no matter where you stand, it spells out ART. Besides this sculpture, the UMMA frequently updates their exterior designs and displays, so even just walking past the museum is an experience in itself. One unique thing about the UMMA is that some of the art displays are even located inside drawers and require you to pull out each drawer, adding an element of surprise to the experience. There is also a cafe on the first floor of the museum for grabbing a quick bite.

- University of Michigan Museum of Natural History [UMMNH](https://lsa.umich.edu/ummnh) is located on the hill area, just a few steps from the Central Campus Transit Center (CCTC). Unlike the UMMA, the information and exhibits at UMMNH are a lot more interactive, perfect for anyone who enjoys hands-on experiences and prefers visual learning. Some of the most popular displays include the dinosaur skeleton displays, planetarium, and the multimedia Tree of Life exhibit.
