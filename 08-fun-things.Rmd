- Every summer, there is an [Art Fair](https://www.theannarborartfair.com/) in July where many vendors will come and set up tents on the streets of downtown Ann Arbor and sell their artwork or other artistic items. This is a great way to learn about all the unique designs and objects people hand make.

- During the month of July, there is also a [carnival](https://a2jaycees.org/carnival) at Pioneer High School, located just across the street from the Michigan Stadium. Even as a graduate student, booths with fair games and food, a Ferris wheel, and other amusement park rides will be hard to resist on a hot summer day!
