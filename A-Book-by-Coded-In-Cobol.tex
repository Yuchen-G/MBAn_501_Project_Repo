We are Coded in Cobol. Our proposal is to create a detailed e-guide for newly admitted MBAn students. This guide can help students get familiar with the campus environment and make full use of the resources around them effectively.

In class yesterday we talked with you about the fact that multiple groups are pursuing a similar idea. We plan to meet with these groups after submitting the proposal to split the tasks into three parts and then combine our three websites into one big website. Some specifics on the things we want to cover are:
