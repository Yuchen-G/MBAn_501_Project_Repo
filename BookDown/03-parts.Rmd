### **A little bit about me:**

I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign with a BS in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics. I look back fondly on my undergrad days where I was an Ambassador for the amazing Economics department, the Head Teaching Assistant for a Business Statistics Course and a Senior Associate at Illinois Business Consulting. **GO ILLINI!**

In today's world organizations are coming up with so many fascinating data and tech driven solutions to previously insurmountable problems. I want to be part of such a force that impacts the world positively. To achieve those high-level data science skills, I recently started my Masters of Business Analytics at the Ross School of Business!
