Our proposal is to create a detailed e-guide for newly admitted MBAn students. This guide can help students get familiar with the campus environment and make full use of the resources around them effectively. In class yesterday we talked with you about the fact that multiple groups are pursuing a similar idea. We plan to meet with these groups after submitting the proposal to split the tasks into three parts and then combine our three websites into one big website. Some specifics on the things we want to cover are: 2.1 Housing tips Dining plan/meal prep tips Best local restaurants and bars Fun things to do Technology tips Most Instagrammable Spots In Michigan Transportation Tips Study Spots Sports "],["cross.html", "Chapter 3 Cross-references 3.1 Chapters and sub-chapters 3.2 Captioned figures and tables", " Chapter 3 Cross-references Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book. 3.1 Chapters and sub-chapters There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}. Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

If youd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your books title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your books source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapters source file.
