Our proposal is to create a detailed e-guide for newly admitted MBAn students. This guide can help students get familiar with the campus environment and make full use of the resources around them effectively. In class yesterday we talked with you about the fact that multiple groups are pursuing a similar idea. We plan to meet with these groups after submitting the proposal to split the tasks into three parts and then combine our three websites into one big website.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

I grew up playing Football, a.k.a soccer, and my favorite team was and still is Manchester United. Education I graduated from the University of Michigan with High Honors in Biology and International Studies. During my first two years as an undergraduate student I had the opportunity to work on a research project at the Medical School where we researched preventive medical treatments for strokes. During my senior year I wrote my thesis on the current civil war in Yemen, and I researched the Islamic Movement of Ansar Allah which is currently leading the political scene in Yemen and the Arabian Peninsula. Professional Experience After graduating I interned for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, and worked on a project that persuaded the Biden Administration to enforce the reopening of Sana‚Äôs Airport and push for a peace resolution between the parties involved in the war. After my internship, I started to work as a Data Analyst for Amazon. My plan after I graduate from Ross is to go back to Amazon and work as Business Intelligence Engineer.

If you‚Äôd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book‚Äôs title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book‚Äôs source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter‚Äôs source file.
