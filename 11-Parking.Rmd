# Available Parking Spots around Ross

Finding a parking spot in Central Campus is a very hard challenge for most people, but we have made it so much easier for you. Just copy and paste the coordinates provided for each street to your preferred phone GPS application and good luck on finding a spot near the building you're going to.  

## Before parking your car, here are some things to keep in mind:

1. DO NOT park your car in front of fire hydrants (those red tanks you see in some spots). These are used by the fire trucks when responding to a fire emergency in the area. 
2. DO NOT block driveways when parking your car. 
3. ALWAYS PAY ATTENTION TO STOP SIGNS.
4. The earlier you arrive to campus, the easier it's to find a spot quickly.
