Hello! My name is Yuchen Gao. I'm currently a master student pursuing a [MBAn](https://michiganross.umich.edu/graduate/master-of-business-analytics) degree from the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. I have an undergraduate degree in Information Science from the [School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan.

I am passionate about transforming data into impactful business solutions and would hope to work in the analytics field after getting my master's degree.
