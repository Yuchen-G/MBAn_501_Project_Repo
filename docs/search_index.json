I grew up playing Football, a.k.a soccer, and my favorite team was and still is Manchester United. Education I graduated from the University of Michigan with High Honors in Biology and International Studies. During my first two years as an undergraduate student I had the opportunity to work on a research project at the Medical School where we researched preventive medical treatments for strokes. During my senior year I wrote my thesis on the current civil war in Yemen, and I researched the Islamic Movement of Ansar Allah which is currently leading the political scene in Yemen and the Arabian Peninsula. Professional Experience After graduating I interned for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, and worked on a project that persuaded the Biden Administration to enforce the reopening of Sanas Airport and push for a peace resolution between the parties involved in the war. After my internship, I started to work as a Data Analyst for Amazon. My plan after I graduate from Ross is to go back to Amazon and work as Business Intelligence Engineer. Publications Mawri, Jalal.

They will connect you with subleasers or add you to their addressbook so they can reach out anytime any sublease becomes available. You could also ask for a lease transfer though this is a more expensive option as you need to pay the entire rent for the month. Lease transfers/takeovers are more useful if you want the lease for the entire academic year.

Palmer Field, located on the hill area near the Central Campus Recreational Building (CCRB), is another option for engaging in sports outside of class. Right beside Palmer Field, there are tennis courts, basketball courts, and an outdoor track. Elbel Field is another option for sports. Located on South Campus near the Stadium, this is where intramural beach volleyball, one of the activities that the inaugural class of the MBAn program participated in, takes place. Frisbee and soccer are also often played on Elbel Field. During the school year, the Michigan Marching Band holds practices here. The Arboretum is a great place for those who enjoy hiking, and there are many biking and jogging trails that go through the Arb. The best thing about the Arb is that it looks very different in each season as the leaves fall and change colors, so you will never get tired of walking down those trails during your free time! Every summer, Ann Arbor hosts an Art Fair in July where many vendors will come and set up tents on the streets of downtown Ann Arbor and sell their artwork or other artistic items. This is a great way to learn about all the unique designs and objects people hand make and participate in a local event. During the month of July, there is also the Jaycees Carnival at Pioneer High School, located just across the street from the Michigan Stadium. Even as graduate students, booths with fair games and food, a Ferris wheel, and other amusement park rides will be hard to resist on a hot summer day! Off-campus, there are a lot of parks nearby that are perfect for canoeing, kayaking, fishing, tanning, and outdoor barbeques. Gallup Park and Bandemer Park are among the most popular that many MBAn students visit on the weekends. 7.2 Shopping The summer is also the perfect time to purchase any winter apparel that will help you get through Michigan winters. Although most of the following places are located at least a 30-minute drive from Ann Arbor, it is a good idea to visit them during the summer, for example during the one-week break between the summer and fall semesters, to make sure that you are as well-prepared as possible for the colder months to come. Briarwood Mall is a 10-minute drive from Ross, and it is a great place for a quick weekend shopping trip. Twelve Oaks Mall is located in Novi, approximately a 30-minute drive from Ann Arbor. Somerset is the largest mall near Ann Arbor. It has both a regular side and a high-end side. It is located in Troy, which is about an hours drive from Ann Arbor. Great Lakes Crossing is an outdoor outlet that offers discounted deals on winter apparel and gear. It is in Auburn Hills, which is also about an hours drive from Ann Arbor. Birchrun Outlet is another option for finding affordable winter clothes and boots. Located in Birch Run, this outlet is also about an hours drive from Ann Arbor. 7.3 Downtown Ann Arbor Downtown Ann Arbor is home to many of the most Instagrammable spots in Ann Arbor, not only is there a graffi alley and murals, there are also many fancy restaurants to take any foodies content to the next level. One cannot talk about downtown Ann Arbor without mentioning Kerrytown, where the Farmers Market is held every Wednesday and Saturday morning.

Check out the Michigan Theater or State Theater, both of which are located on and near South State Street. If you want to go off campus or have a wider selection of films, Cinemark is also a nearby option. 7.4.2 Museums University of Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA) is located in the heart of central campus, and the tall red sculpture right outside can be easily spotted anywhere on South State Street. One fun fact about this sculpture is that no matter where you stand, it spells out ART. Besides this sculpture, the UMMA frequently updates their exterior designs and displays, so even just walking past the museum is an experience in itself. One unique thing about the UMMA is that a few of the displays are interactive and may require you to pull out drawers to reveal the artwork inside, adding an element of surprise to the museum experience. There is also a cafe on the first floor of the museum for grabbing a quick snack. University of Michigan Museum of Natural History (UMMNH) is located on the hill area, just a few steps from the Central Campus Transit Center (CCTC). The information and exhibits at UMMNH are a lot more interactive, perfect for anyone who enjoys hands-on experiences or prefers visual learning. Some of the most popular displays include the dinosaur skeleton displays, planetarium, and the multimedia Tree of Life exhibit. Kelsey Museum of Archaeology is located diagonally across the street from UMMA. Although smaller in size, this museum specializes in Classical, Egyptian, and Middle Eastern archaeology and has over 10,000 artifacts for you to explore and examine. Detroit Observatory is perfect for anyone interested in astronomy and star-gazing. Located right behind Couzens and next to Alice Lloyd Residential Halls on the hill area, the Detroit Observatory is home to the famous Fitz Refracting and Meridian Circle Telescopes. 7.4.3 Miscellaneous Karaoke: Midnight Karaoke, Friends Karaoke, Circ Bar Ax-throwing: Axe Ventura Bowling: Revel&amp;Roll, Station300 Escape Rooms: Breakout Escape Rooms, Decode, Clueless Escape Rooms 7.5 Athletic Events A huge part of the Michigan school spirit comes from athletics, namely football, basketball, and hockey.

Since many students from the first cohort had not used these tools before, learning how to set up the environment and use the software caused much headache among us. So our advice for incoming students who has little experience in these tools is to try to set up the environment and familiarize yourself with the tools before the summer session begin. ### Python Preperation To set up Python correctly in your computer, you should first download the latest version of the programming language from the official website. Then you will need a code editor to write code and manage your files. We recommend using Visual Studio Code because of its simplicity and popularity (Dont confuse it with Visual Studio, its two different things! Visual Studio has a purple icon while VS Code has a blue icon). You can download the latest version from here. Thirdly, dont confuse python file with a jupyter notebook. You can distinguish the two different files by looking at the file name extension. Python is ended with .py while Jupyter Notebook is ended with .ipynb. In MBAn 550, we will primarily work with pure python file. 8.1.1 Excel Preperation In MBAn 551, we will learn about the advanced functions about Excel. But first make sure you have the latest version of the Microsoft 365. UM students have free access to the office suite, and you can download from here. However, keep in mind that some functions are not support in the Mac version of the Excel, so Mac users will need to use Ross Anywhere to access the virtual PC machine to use the Excel Windows version. 8.1.2 Git and GitHub Git and GitHub are two different things. Git is a version control system while GitHub is a cloud platform that hosts service for software development and version control using Git. If you are new to Git, it can be very difficult to understand its logic and navigate the different Git commands. You may find the crash course and the Git cheat sheet to be helpful. 8.1.3 R &amp; RStudio R and RStudio is similar to Python and VS Code. R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics while RStudio is a code editor to write R scripts. In MBAn501, you will primarily working with RMD files in RStudio. RMD file lets you interact with the code you write and is similar to jupyter notebook file. During the course, you will also need to learn to use git in RStudio to work on the project with your teammates.

We utilized our Team Charter to set up rules and norms for the whole team which made our meetings more productive. We used GitHub regularly to improve our efficiency in finishing projects on time. The midpoint survey helped us highlight the areas that we need to improve on. Setting up meetings with at least a 24 hours note. Putting a title for each meeting so that everyone can prepare for the topic were meeting for. One of the Agile principles that were trying to apply in our work is simplicity. Our goal is to design a website that is simple, yet provides new MBAn students with all the resources they need when arriving at Ross. We established a norm where all ideas are presented on a board and we vote on them making our team work more inclusive and democratic. Our group did well in setting up clear goals to achieve for each meeting. A typical Coded in COBOL meeting includes an agenda and a breakdown of bullet points for discussion. We often schedule work meetings 3 days ahead, giving each member plenty of time for preparation that leads to meaningful discussion. 12.2 Handling Challenges and Changes How our group handled challenges and changes. We are very supportive of each other as a team. We each had some trouble setting up GitHub initially. So the members who figured out how to push/pull were able to sort out any issues the other members had. We had the same website idea as some of the other teams, but instead of switching our topic, we approached the professor with our take on a Guide to Ann Arbor, and our plan to differentiate our site from the others with a particular focus on housing. Our passion for our project let us to convince him. 12.3 Leveraging Strengths and Division of Labor How we divided work and leveraged the unique strengths of each individual on the team. We broke the project into small pieces such as setting up GitHub pages, building books, etc. In terms of the book content, we also divided the sections of the book based on the strengths listed on our team charter. For example, Ben was experienced with google Forms and google sheet so he contributed to the sublease information form. Yuchen had previous experience with RStidio and GitHub so he was in charge of setting up GitHub and helping other members in the team with syncing with the remote repository. Other team members contributed to the project by setting up goals and timelines, and ensuring everyone in the team is working efficiently. 12.4 Agile Work Practices How our group adopted agile work practices. We adopted several agile work practices in our group to keep the development process smooth and efficient. For one, we decided to name our gatherings according to the task to be done during that session. When unexpected challenges arose and forced us to change the scope of our project, we held a Scope Change Document Write-up session to document the changes to be made to our website, rather than a weekly meeting. When we arrived at the meeting, we were all prepared to dive into the task and did not have the feeling of dread accompanied by attending routine meetings. Second, we decided to eliminate minutes kept from our team charter. This allowed the meetings to flow much more organically and reduce the formality of the meetings. Finally, we decided to project work on one big screen in our meeting rooms to eliminate distractions and develop a central focus on the task. 12.5 Managing Complexities How we managd the RMarkdown/Git/GitHub complexity and learning curve. Each of us made unique About Me websites, so everyone came in with different things they knew how to add in RMarkdown. This allowed us to show each other what we were capable of creating and allowed us to create a more visually-pleasing website using RMarkdown. As mentioned above, using Git and GitHub was difficult, especially with all the committing, pulling, and pushing we needed to do. After many tries, everyone on the team knows how to do it by themselves now so we can keep working on our website outside of team meetings, and this greatly increases our team productivity and efficiency. 12.6 Plans Moving Forward What our group thought we could do better. One way to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of our team in the remaining days is to set clear objectives and goals for each meeting. This way, every member can come to each meeting with their completed parts and be ready for discussion and revision. At the end of each meeting, we should schedule subsequent meetings and make sure everyone understands what they need to have completed by the next meeting. 12.7 Final Thoughts Our group did well in setting up clear goals to achieve for each meeting. A typical Coded in Cobol meeting includes an agenda and a breakdown of bullet points for discussion. We often schedule work meetings 3 days ahead, giving each member plenty of time for preparation that leads to meaningful discussion.
