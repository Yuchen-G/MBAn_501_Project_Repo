I grew up playing Football, a.k.a soccer, and my favorite team was and still is Manchester United. Education I graduated from the University of Michigan with High Honors in Biology and International Studies. During my first two years as an undergraduate student I had the opportunity to work on a research project at the Medical School where we researched preventive medical treatments for strokes. During my senior year I wrote my thesis on the current civil war in Yemen, and I researched the Islamic Movement of Ansar Allah which is currently leading the political scene in Yemen and the Arabian Peninsula. Professional Experience After graduating I interned for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, and worked on a project that persuaded the Biden Administration to enforce the reopening of Sana‚Äôs Airport and push for a peace resolution between the parties involved in the war. After my internship, I started to work as a Data Analyst for Amazon. My plan after I graduate from Ross is to go back to Amazon and work as Business Intelligence Engineer.

They will connect you with subleasers or add you to their addressbook so they can reach out anytime any sublease becomes available. You could also ask for a lease transfer though this is a more expensive option as you need to pay the entire rent for the month. Lease transfers/takeovers are more useful if you want the lease for the entire academic year.
