Palmer Field, located on the hill area near the Central Campus Recreational Building (CCRB), is another option for engaging in sports outside of class. Right beside Palmer Field, there are tennis courts, basketball courts, and an outdoor track. Elbel Field is another option for sports. Located on South Campus near the Stadium, this is where intramural beach volleyball, one of the activities that the inaugural class of the MBAn program participated in, takes place. Frisbee and soccer are also often played on Elbel Field. During the school year, the Michigan Marching Band holds practices here. The Arboretum is a great place for those who enjoy hiking, and there are many biking and jogging trails that go through the Arb. Every summer, there is an Art Fair in July where many vendors will come and set up tents on the streets of downtown Ann Arbor and sell their artwork or other artistic items. This is a great way to learn about all the unique designs and objects people hand make. During the month of July, there is also a carnival at Pioneer High School, located just across the street from the Michigan Stadium. Even as a graduate student, booths with fair games and food, a Ferris wheel, and other amusement park rides will be hard to resist on a hot summer day! Off-campus, there are a lot of parks nearby that are perfect for canoeing, kayaking, fishing, tanning, and outdoor barbeques. Gallup Park and Bandemer Park are among the most popular that many MBAn students visit on the weekends. 7.2 Shopping The summer is also the perfect time to purchase any winter apparel that will help you get through Michigan winters. Although the following places are located at least a 30-minute drive from Ann Arbor, it is a good idea to visit them during the summer, for example during the one-week break between the summer and fall semesters, to make sure that you are as well-prepared as possible for the colder months.

Somerset is the largest mall near Ann Arbor. It has both a regular side and a high-end side. It is located in Troy, which is about an hour’s drive from Ann Arbor.

Birchrun Outlet is another option for finding affordable winter clothes and boots. Located in Birch Run, this outlet is also about an hour’s drive from Ann Arbor. 7.3 Downtown Ann Arbor Downtown Ann Arbor is home to many of the most Instagrammable spots in Ann Arbor, not only is there a graffi alley and murals, there are also many fancy restaurants to take any foodie’s content to the next level. One cannot talk about downtown Ann Arbor without mentioning Kerrytown, where the Farmers’ Market is held every Wednesday and Saturday morning.
