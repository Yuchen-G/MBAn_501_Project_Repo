I grew up playing Football, a.k.a soccer, and my favorite team was and still is Manchester United. Education I graduated from the University of Michigan with High Honors in Biology and International Studies. During my first two years as an undergraduate student I had the opportunity to work on a research project at the Medical School where we researched preventive medical treatments for strokes. During my senior year I wrote my thesis on the current civil war in Yemen, and I researched the Islamic Movement of Ansar Allah which is currently leading the political scene in Yemen and the Arabian Peninsula. Professional Experience After graduating I interned for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, and worked on a project that persuaded the Biden Administration to enforce the reopening of Sana’s Airport and push for a peace resolution between the parties involved in the war. After my internship, I started to work as a Data Analyst for Amazon. My plan after I graduate from Ross is to go back to Amazon and work as Business Intelligence Engineer.
