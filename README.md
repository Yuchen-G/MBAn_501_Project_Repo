Welcome! 

This is the final project for the MBAn501. It is a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). 

We hope this book can provide future MBAn students with information about the best places to hangout around AA.

You can view the book here: https://yuchen-g.github.io/MBAn_501_Project_Repo/index.html
