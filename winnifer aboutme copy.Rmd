### Educational Background
I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Economics with a minor in Statistics from the University of Michigan in April 2022. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Business Analytics at the University of Michigan - Stephen M. Ross School of Business, with an expected graduation date of April 2023.

### Fun Facts!
- I am from Ann Arbor, MI, but throughout my life, I have also lived in Charlotte, NC and Taipei, Taiwan.
- I come from a family of Wolverines! Both of my parents also attended graduate school at Michigan, and my younger sister is starting her freshman year this fall. GO BLUE!
- In my free time, I love to spend time outdoors, whether that is hiking, camping, or taking pictures of scenery. Check out some of the pictures I took: https://vsco.co/winniferchen/gallery
- I really enjoy rewatching music videos and performances by my favorite kpop groups. One of my dreams is to go to a kpop concert one day and sit in the very front section. 
- Immersing myself in the world of kdramas is another way for me to wind down and relax after a long day. 
- Something that I want to do more this year is trying new recipes and cooking more.
