**Background**

I was born and raised in Yemen, the old city of Sana'a, and I left the country in 2013 with my family and immigrated to the United States. I grew up playing Football, a.k.a soccer, and my favorite team was and still is Manchester United.

- During my first two years as an undergraduate student I had the opportunity to work on a research project at the Medical School where we researched preventive medical treatments for strokes.
- During my senior year I wrote my thesis on the current civil war in Yemen, and I researched the Islamic Movement of Ansar Allah which is currently leading the political scene in Yemen and the Arabian Peninsula.

**Professional Experience**

- After graduating I interned for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, and worked on a project that persuaded the Biden Administration to enforce the reopening of Sana's Airport and push for a peace resolution between the parties involved in the war.
