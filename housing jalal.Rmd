##Housing
Looking for a place to stay in Ann Arbor could be a nightmare. That's why we created this place where admitted and graduating MBAn students can help each other in leasing and subleasing apartments/houses. 

## Looking for a Place to Stay? 

Many graduating MBAn students are looking to sublet their house/apartment. You can view this google sheet and find all places available that are being sublet by MBAn students.
