## Restaurants

**Sava's**

Sava's is a modern, upscale eatery serving mostly American dishes. They have many great mac and cheese varieties, a nice bar, and the interior was recently renovated in 2021. It is a bit on the pricey side, so it a great place to take the parents (;

**Frita Batidos**

Frita Batidos serves delicious Cuban street food. The restaurant's name is inspired by two staples in the world of Cuban street food: the "frita," which is a burger traditionally made from spicy chorizo served with shoestring fries on top in a soft egg bun and the "batido," which is a tropical milkshake made with fresh fruit, crushed ice, and sweetened milk.

Mani-Osteria is an italian restaurant serving wood-oven pizza & specialty small plates plus a bar with old-world wines & local beer. It was also voted "most romantic in Ann Arbor." They have outdoor seating here as well.

**Tomukun Korean Barbecue and Noodle Bar**

My personal favorite, this combination barbecue-noodle bar offers a great combination of traditional Korean dishes and inventive culinary creations. The barbecue offers guests the chance to cook meat variety platters on personal tabletop grills. The noodle bar is always packed, but great for affordable and delicious take-out.

**The Gandy Dancer**

Situated in the beautifully restored 1886 Michigan Central Depot, Gandy Dancer is both an architectural landmark and an elegant restaurant. A popular venue in Ann Arbor, the Gandy Dancer's fine cuisine and historic atmosphere make a grand setting for rehearsal dinners and wedding receptions. Come see why diners all over Michigan choose us time and time again.

**The Grotto**

The Grotto features 36 constantly-rotating craft beer taps from over the US and around the world, and world-class wines. They also have a decently sized outdoor seating area. Once you're tipsy, you can visit Fleetwood across the street for some hippie hash (:

**The Brown Jug**

Located just one block away from Ross, the Brown Jug is a classic American bar where you can come and hang out with friends. They have lots of good specials here, such as $10 for a bucket of 5 Blue Moons. Its namesake comes from the Michigan vs Minnesota football trophy, which is the oldest in college football.
