## Restaurants

**Sava's**

Sava's is a modern, upscale eatery serving mostly American dishes. They have many great mac and cheese varieties, a nice bar, and the interior was recently renovated in 2021. It is a bit on the pricey side, so it a great place to take the parents (;

**Frita Batidos**

Frita Batidos serves delicious Cuban street food. The restaurant's name is inspired by two staples in the world of Cuban street food: the "frita," which is a burger traditionally made from spicy chorizo served with shoestring fries on top in a soft egg bun and the "batido," which is a tropical milkshake made with fresh fruit, crushed ice, and sweetened milk.

**Tomukun Korean Barbecue and Noodle Bar**

My personal favorite, this combination barbecue-noodle bar offers a great combination of traditional Korean dishes and inventive culinary creations. The barbecue offers guests the chance to cook meat variety platters on personal tabletop grills. The noodle bar is always packed, but great for affordable and delicious take-out.
