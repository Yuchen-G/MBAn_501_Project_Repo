#Parking 🚗

Finding a parking spot in Central Campus is a very hard challenge for most people, but we have made it so much easier for you. Just copy and paste the coordinates provided for each street to your preferred phone GPS application and good luck on finding a spot near the building you're going to.  

## Before parking your car, here are some things to keep in mind:

1. **DO NOT** park your car in front of fire hydrants. These are used by the fire emergency trucks when responding to an emergency in the area. You might get a ticket or get your car towed if your car was found near one of them.

2. **DO NOT** block driveways when parking your car. This could also result in your car getting towed or you receive a ticket.

3. **ALWAYS PAY ATTENTION TO STOP SIGNS.**
